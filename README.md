# Steganography
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data.
Using this tool we can hide one image into another without getting detected about the second image. This process is very vital in the aspect of data security. It mainly helps in hiding data of one source into another.
This tool includes the process of merging one image file into another. Further it can also be unmerged using the same tool.
Initially both the images will be in the format of jpg, when they are merged the target file will be exported in the form of png.
